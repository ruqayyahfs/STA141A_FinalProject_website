**Riley Adams:** Riley was a main collaborator in the overall planning and conceptual direction of the study. He contributed to data exploration, and data cleaning, including collaborating on the code written. He produced figures \@ref(fig:histBudget) , \@ref(fig:bothBox), \@ref(fig:scoreVotesCorr) , and \@ref(fig:residualsPlots) . He also took the lead on implementation of the Section \@ref(mr), writing all the code involved. He also was the main contributor for the write up of Section \@ref(mr) as well as the "multiple regression" portion of Section \@ref(dc) and "Responding to comment #1" in Section \@ref(dv) . He also implemented the formatting and production of the final document through the "bookdown" library in the R programming language, and creation Section \@ref(bib).

**Ruqayyah Siddique:** Ruqayyah was the main collaborator on creating the website to view the analysis report. She contributed to the write-up of Section \@ref(ca) and interpreting the dendrograms, as well as the tables produced from the `means_by_cluster()` function). She also collaborated on producing a conclusion for the "hierarchial clustering" portion of Section \@ref(dc).
